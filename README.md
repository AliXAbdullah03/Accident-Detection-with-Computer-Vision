# Accident-Detection-with-Computer-Vision
This project implements an accident detection system using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. The model processes input frames to accurately detect accidents in real-time and generates notifications accordingly. This innovative solution enhances road safety by providing timely alerts and situational awareness.
